# MacAddress.io API in Node.js

The MAC address vendor API allows you to retrieve OUI vendor information, detect virtual machines, manufacturer, location, read the information encoded in the MAC address, and get our research's results regarding the given MAC address, OUI, IAB, and is based on https://macaddress.io/api service.

# Obtain your apiKey.

You'll need a query-based authentication.
A personal apiKey is required.
To obtain one please go to:
https://macaddress.io/signup

Once you have it you can use it to run the app.

# How to run the console/terminal version

1. Place the app files inside your app folder.
2. On root folder run: # API_KEY=your_apiKey node src
3. Provide your Mac Address when the console ask for it.

# How to run the server version

1. Place the app files inside your app folder.
2. On root folder run: # API_KEY=your_apiKey node server
3. Do a GET request from a client and include parameters as in the next example.

Example: https://localhost:YOUR_PORT/v1?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY&output=json&search=YOUR_SEARCH

## Input parameters

- apiKey --> Required. Your personal API key. You can obtain one here: https://macaddress.io/signup
- search --> Your MacAddress. Example: '44:38:39:ff:ef:57'
- output --> Optional. Output format: json, xml, csv, vendor (default)

# Security

Save your API_KEY inside an evironmental variable and read it from there.
Never include your API_KEY value directly on your code.

Once you setup your API_KEY enviorment variable you can run the app as follows:
For console app: # node src
For server app: # node server

# Why I did two versions for the assesment?

I'm more used to make server Apps instead of Console Apps. So, I decided to go first with what I know and latter go through the unknown.

But I discovered that was very easy to develop the console approach once I had the server approach.

On the server approach I made a custom queryString module just in case I wouldn't be allowed to use Node.js querystring module.

# 100% Node.js app

Both apps are pure Node.js applications without any dependencies and/or package.json files.

# Improvements to work on.

- Validate Mac Address (regex ?)
- Validate ApiKey is present.
- Docker image file.
